# Dive Slate
Dive Slate is a Ruby on Rails web application for scuba divers to log the details and technical specifications of their dives electronically, in whatever country, island, or oceans their underwater adventures take them to.  Dive Slate keeps track of dive highlights, photos of marine life seen, and any technical notes that the user would like to record (wetsuit thickness, depth, wreck penetration path, etc.).  Users can also discover dive sites and dive shops, as well as share their dive details with friends.

# Motivation
As an avid diver, I wanted a way to record my dives without having to remember to bring my paper dive log book and ballpoint pen.  I also didn't want to record all of the super technical details (and repetitive fields) of my dives that weren't already saved in my dive com.  Therefore, I wanted to create a web app that gives divers the ability to have their logbook at their fingertips so they can log a dive from anywhere or show their friends the awesome hammerhead shark they saw in the Galapagos.
